                    <p>In Direct Healing session we place our hands directly on affected area of your body so that energy flowing through our hands can get imbibed in your affected part. The flow of energy and duration is depends on your requirement of recovery. Most of the people think healing treatments are ‘in ‘ person’ form of only. </p>

                    <p><strong>Have you ever heard that the benefit of this healing treatment can be taken even from distance?</strong><br />
                        Let me enrich your knowledge with other form of Reiki treatment i.e Distance reiki Yes! Reiki treatment can be obtained even from distance and can be given to  to anyone across any corner of the world. If you are unable to make it in person for a reiki treatment, you can still receive a distance / remote healing session. It’s the exact same as receiving it in person so it means you can get the support you need</p>

                    <p>It is possible because energy is not confined and can transcend time and space so it is easily transmitted anywhere. Although at first it may be difficult to trust but, there are many instances where  people have actually benefitted and  have yielded good results <strong>These services can also be offered for the wellbeing of relatives or friends who may not be aware of the Reiki or its benefits and can help them to bring balance in their physical and emotional health </strong> . Just to narrate a simple example  myself have cured one of my relatives ‘chronic breathlessness and asthmatic trauma with distant Reiki in three sessions without being asked to be in a receptive position . Of course the time required for result to be achieved depends on nature of your problem as well as illness also.
                    </p>

                    <p>Learn how to shift your perspective and live from a place of love, compassion and gratitude.&nbsp; Appreciate the world around you and let nature nourish your body, mind and soul. Become aware of and break through your subconscious limitations. Restore balance, harmony and flow in you and your life.</p>

                    <p>Normally for physical or emotional issues at least for 21 to 45 days Reiki Sessions are required.<strong>However, Reiki can work magically even in lesser period as I explained earlier about my relative.</strong>

                    <p>With distant reiki I can also help you to clean aura of your house, can bring balance in relationship with your loving ones, can also help your pets to come out of physical illness they are facing.</p>

                    <p>
                        Please note that you do not need to be into spirituality to enjoy the benefits of reiki. It can be requested for adults, children and babies.  Reiki can also foster significant help in coping with highly stressful situations such as surgery, exams, court cases etc, as well as reducing the side-effects of invasive treatments and accelerating recovery from serious illness or surgery.

                                After session people mostly feels refreshed and rejuvenated, sometimes they may experience more tiredness, but nothing to worry as this is not any adverse reaction but body’s natural healing response towards the treatment. People commonly report a sense of calm and mental clarity and sleeping well after Reiki.
